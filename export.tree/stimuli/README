This dataset of audio clips was compiled to serve as a collection of stimuli for psychological and neuroimaging studies where participants listened to naturalistic spoken stories. The goal of these publicly-funded, strictly non-commercial scholarly research studies was to better understand how humans process natural language and comprehend complex narratives. Unfortunately, at the time of study design, we were not aware of sufficient publicly available high-quality collection of suitable clips which was in the public domain or released under free licenses, and thus had to compile our own set of stimuli for the studies. The audio clips are, however, freely available online at their respective sources. To facilitate reproducibility and promote the replicabilion of our scientific findings, and to add to the scientific value of the neuroimaging datasets associated with this study which we have released publicly, we were prompted to share this stimulus dataset. The studies for which this stimulus dataset was compiled were publicly funded by the National Institute of Mental Health at the National Institutes of Health (grant numbers R01-MH094480, DP1-HD091948, R01-MH112566, R01-MH112357, T32-MH065214), which has developed policies promoting data sharing:
